Flow-Designer
=============

This is the Flow Designer sample for Obeo Designer. 

You can find a video of this designer at the home page of https://www.eclipse.org/sirius

To install it, the easiest way is to download Obeo Designer Community Edition 7.0 which provides a ready-to-use bundle with Sirius 2. Just check out this source code, and use a runtime workspace to try the sample with these two projects:
* org.obeonetwork.sample.robot
* fr.obeo.dsl.designer.sample.flow.design


Last change: 
* Upgrade to Sirius 2.0 (and OD 7.0.1)
* Simplify the VSM for the demo purpose
* Improve the L&F of the sample.

The very next steps for this project are:
* upgrade to Sirius 3.0
* CDO-ification of the metamodel
